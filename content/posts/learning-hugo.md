Learning Hugo will not be the easiest ever. I am a bit lost but it seems the book [Hugo in Action](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hugo-in-action/9781617297007/)
will be a must reed. Thanks God I have Oreilly for which I am spending too much money and not reading enough. I will update the post once I started the book with my opition on it.
